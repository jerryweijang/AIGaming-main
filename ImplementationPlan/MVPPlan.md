MVP 2: Enhanced Single-Player Experience

Goal: Improve the single-player mode with better tracks, visuals, and gameplay elements.
Steps for MVP 2

    Design Complex Tracks:
        Use Three.js to create a track with curves (e.g., CurvePath), ramps (BoxGeometry angled upward), and loops (extrude a circular path).
    Enhance Car Model:
        Add wheel meshes (CylinderGeometry) and animate their rotation based on speed.
    Add Jumping:
        Apply an upward force to carBodyPhysics when pressing a key (e.g., Spacebar).
    Add Obstacles:
        Place static BoxGeometry objects on the track with corresponding Cannon-es bodies; detect collisions.
    Scoring System:
        Deduct points or add time penalties for hitting obstacles; display the score.
    Create a Menu:
        Add an HTML overlay with "Start" and "Replay" buttons; toggle visibility with JavaScript.
    Add Sound Effects:
        Use THREE.Audio to play engine sounds, collision noises, and a start beep.
    Replay Feature:
        Record car positions each frame and replay them after finishing.

MVP 3: Multiplayer Functionality

Goal: Enable real-time multiplayer racing with other players.
Steps for MVP 3

    Set Up Server:
        Create a server.js file, install express and socket.io (npm install express socket.io), and set up a basic Node.js server.
    Lobby System:
        Use Socket.IO to let players join a room; emit a "start" event when all are ready.
    Sync Race Start:
        Broadcast a countdown to all clients via the server.
    Sync Player Positions:
        Send key inputs to the server; calculate and broadcast positions to all clients.
    Handle Latency:
        Use client-side prediction and server reconciliation for smooth gameplay.
    Display Other Players:
        Add additional car meshes for other players, updated with server data.
    Leaderboard:
        Send finish times to the server; display a ranked list post-race.
    Optional Chat:
        Add a text input in the lobby for players to send messages via Socket.IO.

MVP 4: Additional Features and Polish

Goal: Add extra features and optimize the game for a polished experience.
Steps for MVP 4

    Track Editor:
        Create a UI to place track segments (e.g., straight, curve, ramp) and save them as JSON.
    Database:
        Install MongoDB, use mongoose to store high scores and tracks.
    Login System:
        Add user authentication with email/password via the server.
    Leaderboards:
        Query the database to show top times globally or per track.
    AI Opponents:
        Implement basic AI that follows a predefined path with random variations.
    Monetization:
        Add banner ads via an ad network or premium tracks purchasable with a payment API.
    Mobile Optimization:
        Adjust controls for touch input (e.g., on-screen buttons) and test performance.
    User Testing:
        Share the game with friends, collect feedback, and iterate.

Getting Started

Start with MVP 1 by following the detailed steps above. Once you have a car racing to the finish line with a timer, you’ll have a working prototype! Then, move to MVP 2 to polish the single-player experience, followed by MVP 3 for multiplayer, and MVP 4 for extra features. Each MVP builds on the last, ensuring steady progress.
