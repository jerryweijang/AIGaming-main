Game Design Document
1. Game Overview

    Concept: A lightweight, browser-based racing game inspired by TrackMania, featuring fast-paced races, simple controls, and real-time multiplayer functionality.
    Target Audience: Casual gamers and racing enthusiasts looking for quick, accessible fun in a browser.
    Platforms: Web browsers (desktop and mobile-compatible).
    Objective: Race against others or the clock on pre-designed tracks with jumps, loops, and obstacles, aiming for the fastest time.

2. Gameplay Mechanics

    Controls:
        Keyboard-based: Arrow keys or WASD for acceleration, braking, and steering.
        Simple and intuitive for quick pick-up-and-play.
    Physics:
        Basic car physics including acceleration, deceleration, turning, and collision detection.
        Lightweight simulation suitable for a browser environment.
    Tracks:
        Pre-designed 3D tracks with elements like ramps, loops, and obstacles.
        Tracks are short (30 seconds to 2 minutes) to keep gameplay fast-paced.
    Multiplayer:
        Real-time racing with up to 4-8 players per session (adjustable based on testing).
        Players join a lobby, and races start when all players are ready.

3. Features

    Single Player:
        Time trials mode to practice or compete against personal bests.
        Optional AI opponents for added challenge (if time permits).
    Multiplayer:
        Lobby system for joining races.
        Real-time synchronization of player positions and race start times.
    Track Editor (Optional):
        Basic editor to create and save custom tracks, enhancing replayability.
        Shareable via unique codes or a database (if implemented).
    Leaderboards:
        Display top times globally or per track.
        Optional account system for persistent rankings.

4. Technical Requirements

    Frontend:
        Graphics: Three.js for 3D rendering.
        Physics: Cannon.js for car and track physics.
        UI: Plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript or React for a structured interface.
    Backend:
        Server: Node.js with Express and Socket.IO for real-time multiplayer.
        Database (Optional): MongoDB for storing user data, high scores, or custom tracks.
    Embedding:
        Delivered as a single HTML file or a small set of files, embeddable via an <iframe> or direct integration into your website.

5. Art and Sound

    Graphics:
        Simple 3D models for cars (e.g., low-poly designs) and tracks (modular pieces like straight roads, curves, ramps).
        Minimal textures to keep it lightweight.
    Sound:
        Background music (looping track).
        Sound effects: engine hum, collisions, and a race start beep.

6. Monetization (Optional)

    Integrate ads (e.g., banner ads around the game frame).
    Offer premium tracks or cosmetic car skins as in-game purchases.

Recommended Technology Stack

Here’s the tech stack I recommend, tailored to your desire to code it yourself and your interest in Python, Three.js, and Cannon.js:
Frontend

    Three.js:
        A JavaScript library for 3D graphics in the browser.
        Perfect for rendering cars, tracks, and basic animations.
        Why? It’s lightweight, has excellent documentation, and integrates seamlessly with web technologies.
    Cannon.js:
        A JavaScript physics engine designed to work with Three.js.
        Handles car movement, collisions, and gravity.
        Why? It’s simple, performant, and pairs naturally with Three.js for a racing game.
    HTML/CSS/JavaScript:
        For the user interface (e.g., menus, leaderboards, lobby).
        Optionally, use React if you prefer a structured framework, but plain JS works fine for a lightweight game.
        Why? Native to the web, ensuring easy embedding into your site.

Backend

    Node.js with Express and Socket.IO:
        Node.js runs the server, Express handles basic routing, and Socket.IO enables real-time communication for multiplayer.
        Why? JavaScript-based (consistent with frontend), widely used for real-time apps, and straightforward to learn.
        Example Use: Synchronize player positions, start races, and broadcast results.
    Database (Optional):
        MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing high scores, user accounts, or custom tracks.
        Why? Easy to integrate with Node.js and flexible for small-scale data needs.

Why Not Python?

You mentioned Python, which is a fantastic language, but for a web-based game, JavaScript is more practical:

    Frontend: Browsers natively run JavaScript, so Three.js and Cannon.js (both JS libraries) are the natural choice. Python isn’t directly usable in the browser without complex setups (e.g., PyScript or transpiling).
    Backend: While Python could work (e.g., with Flask or Django + WebSockets), Node.js aligns better with the frontend stack, reducing the learning curve and keeping everything in one language (JavaScript).
    Alternative: If you’re set on Python, you could use Flask with a WebSocket library (e.g., flask-sockets) for the backend, but you’d still need JavaScript for the frontend.

Embedding

    The game will be a web app (HTML, JS, CSS files).
    Embed it in your website using an <iframe> (e.g., <iframe src="game.html" width="800" height="600"></iframe>) or by directly including the game code in your site’s structure.

Why This Stack Works

    Lightweight: Three.js and Cannon.js avoid the overhead of full game engines like Unity, keeping the game fast in browsers.
    Multiplayer: Socket.IO ensures real-time updates with minimal setup.
    DIY-Friendly: All tools are open-source, well-documented, and manageable for a solo developer.
    Web-Native: JavaScript ensures seamless integration and embeddability.

Potential Challenges & Solutions

    Latency in Multiplayer:
        Use an authoritative server model: the server calculates the game state, and clients send inputs (e.g., key presses).
    Physics Sync:
        Server validates physics to keep all players consistent, with client-side prediction for smoother visuals.
    Performance:
        Optimize by using low-poly models and limiting physics calculations.
        Test on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) and devices.

Next Steps

    Prototype: Start with a single-player version using Three.js and Cannon.js—get a car moving on a simple track.
    Multiplayer: Add Node.js and Socket.IO to sync two players.
    Polish: Implement UI, sounds, and additional features like leaderboards or a track editor as time allows.
    Embed: Test embedding the final game into your website.
